# CalculatorJs

## Description

This is a simple calculator made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It was made to practice my skills with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  Also, I used the [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/) library to evaluate the expressions. The calculator has a dark mode and a light mode.
